# Quick Start:
---

The ipynb file contain the data cleaning and visualization and machine learning models to predict the bank loan approved or not from the given information.

In model.py file we created pickle file from the Random forest model which is the best model among all five model that was created in the ipynb file.

In app.py, used streamlit library to build Bank loan prediction web app.

In templates folder, the tab file shows that tableau visualization of the data analysis.
